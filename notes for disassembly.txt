Notes on demo 1_new.exe

static:
.exe = executeable
it is a MZ

MZ = windows abbreviation for portable execcutable



ELF is the exectuable for linux

strings:

enter key:
Failed!!

success!!.



be sure to look if the file is packed or compressed like having upx at the top



BEHAVIORAL:

on opening "enter key:"

typed "key" got "failed!!" message

takes 5 seconds before window closes after failed!! message

will not break with a lot of A's on this  prompt


Dynamic:

Yep, we did this



Disassembly:

running in gihdra

made for x86 windows 32 bit 

potentially made using visual studio


disassembly takes user input 20bytes from standard input and converts it to integer. if input = 123, then it returns 13555, otherwise returns 12. I
f returned value is 13555 it displays success if not it displays failed waits five seconds then exits.



Static:
demo2_new.exe

made for x86, little Endian 

Behavioral:
"Enter Key" got success.

"is not the Key" when incorrect.

Dynamic:

yup

Disassembly:
IVAR1 needs to = 65664 in order to get success message
takes user input and compares it to stored data 'key' to set internal vairablt to 12 (failure) OR sucess (65664)
