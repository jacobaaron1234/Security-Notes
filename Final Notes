I. Recon and Footprinting:
Network and Host Enumeration:
    1. Identify Live Hosts:
	â€¢ run a ping sweep/ping for-loop from target space to identify live hosts. This MUST BE DONE from target space/previous hop. Your ops box can only see the public internet (and 10.50â€¦ IP addresses)
	â€¢ windows: for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 192.168.1.%i > nul && echo 192.168.1.%i is up.
    	â€¢ linux (must be in bash): for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) 2>/dev/null ;done
    2. Identify Open Ports on Live Hosts:
    	â€¢ Do a simple port scan (nmap -sT or NC) from your ops box against Ips you found in your ping sweep and note open ports
    	â€¢ EX: proxychains nmap -Pn -sT 1.2.3.4 -p 1-1000
    3. Identify Services on Open Ports:
    	â€¢ Run an NC banner grab or nmap version scan (-sV) against open ports found in the previous step and note what service and version is running each discovered port
    	â€¢ EX: proxychains nmap -Pn -sV 1.2.3.4 -p 21-23,80,443
    4. Enumerate Services using nmap scripts
        â—¦http-enum.nse, smb-os-discover.nse etc can get you good info
        â—¦EX: proxychains nmap -Pn -sT 1.2.3.4 -p 80 --script http-enum.nse

II. Web Exploitation:
FTP:
    	â€¢ Wget and curl to pull files
	â€¢ It is possible to use credentials with wget and curl. If you have credentials, you may be able to download additional files that an anonymous FTP wget wonâ€™t grab
	â€¢ You may run an nmap ftp enum script as well if you prefer
SSH and RDP:
	â€¢ If we have creds or keys, try them.
	â€¢ If we don't have creds, keep these ports in mind. Maybe we'll find creds or keys later. Maybe we won't.
SMB:
    	â€¢ run an smb OS enum script from ops box to get information on hostnames, domain names, and network shares.
HTTP:
dig/dns query - probably not necessary in our contained environments
    	â€¢ If there is an internal DNS server, you may need to run your dig/whois from target space
robots.txt
    	â€¢ Open all pages and directories indicated
http-enum script 
    	â€¢ open all discovered pages and directories from ops box
    	â€¢ View the page as presented
    	â€¢ View the page source for links or php that might not be immediately obvious (ctrl+f for href)
    	â€¢ If the page has input boxes, or you see a [?thing=] in your url:
		- Attempt directory traversal (../../../../../../../etc/passwd)
		- Attempt command injection (; cat /etc/passwd)
		- Attempt SQL injection (tom' or 1='1 || tom OR 1=1)
    	â€¢ If SQL Injection works:
		- attempt a login if it's a login page 
			â€¢ tom' or 1='1 in username AND password field
			â€¢ try both POST and GET method
		- Attempt to dump unintended results with the or 1=1 method
		- Identify vulnerable entries and attempt to dump the contents of the entire database using your Golden Statement
			1) Identify vulnerable field or option (value=X OR 1=1)
			2) Identify number of columns required for Union Select (value=X UNION SELECT 1,2,3)
			3) Use Golden Statement to identify user created data (value=X UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name[,4,5...] FROM information_schema.columns)
			4) Profit (value=X UNION SELECT column1,column2,column3... FROM database.table)
	â€¢ If it has a message/chat box or forum:
		- Consider stored XSS or reflected XSS
	â€¢ If there are dropdowns:
		- check for PHP, and attempt GET and POST as above (directory traversal, etc)
		- Check developer console for java code we can control
		- Identify vulnerable entries and attempt SQL Injection to dump the contents of the entire database using your Golden Statement (as above)
	â€¢ If there is an ability to upload AND a way to access what we've uploaded:
		- Upload the command injection php, then see below
	â€¢ If we can get command injection:
		- Look for credentials and ssh keys
		- upload ssh keys if needed
		- use those creds or keys to get on the box

SSH KEY access via malicious upload or command injection:
	â€¢ Once we find a place where we can run commands on target, run 'whoami' to tell us what user is running the webpage
	â€¢ cat /etc/passwd to see where their home directory is and if they get a login shell
	â€¢ check to see if they have a .ssh directory in their home directory. If they don't have one, make one
	â€¢ cat out your ssh public key on your ops box
	â€¢ on the target, echo "[your whole public key]" >> /path/to/users/home/.ssh/authorized_keys
	â€¢ ssh into the target. If using a private key NOT in your .ssh folder AND named id_rsa, you will need to use -i /path/to/private/key

Post-Exploitation:
NIX: 

Enumerate other users:
	- cat /etc/passwd and note users, their home directories, and their login shells
	- cat /etc/group and note user groups (sudo or wheel are standard privileged groups, but check others as well)
	- view /home/ directory and check user directories if able
	- w or who to see who is currently online
Enumerate processes and services of interest:
	- ps -elfH
	- systemctl list-units --type service OR service --status-all
	- check configs (usually in /etc/)
Enumerate Network Info:
	- identify ip & network info with ip a
	- identify current connections and listening services with ss -nltp
	- check /etc/hosts for possible hosts or networks
		Identified hosts and networks should be subjected to the recon steps above)
Enumerate scheduled processes:
	- check /etc/crontab
	- check /etc/cron.d/*
	- check /var/spool/cron* and /var/spool/at
Enumerate other files and directories of interest:
	- Any ssh keys or password files?
	- Anything interesting in /etc/?
	- uname -a or cat /etc/*rel*
	- Check /tmp and /var/tmp
	- syslog or rsyslog configs to see what will log
	- Check /var/log/
	- find / -type [f for file or d for directory] -iname "what you're looking for"
	- Check /root (once priv esc'd)
	- check /etc/shadow (once priv esc'd)
Attempt Priv Esc:
	- identify current privs with sudo -l
	- Identify SUID/SGID bit binaries
		GTFOBins anything that came up from the above two
	- Does anything execute from files or directories we can write to?
	- Are there any root-level cronjobs or writeable cron directories we can write to?
	- Are there other users we can move laterally into who may have more permissions than us?



WINDOWS
Enumerate other users:
	- net user
	- net localgroup
	- query user
	- view C:\Users\ directory and check user directories if able
Enumerate processes and services of interest:
	- tasklist /v OR task manager
	- net start OR services manager
Enumerate Network Info:
	- identify ip/network info with ipconfig /all
	- identify current connections and listening services with netstat /anob
Enumerate scheduled processes:
	- Check schtasks or the Task Scheduler
Enumerate other files and directories of interest:
	**MAKE SURE WHEN CHECKING FILES ON WINDOWS THAT YOU ARE VIEWING HIDDEN FILES**
	- C:\users\
	- C:\Windows\temp
	- [HKLM || HKCU]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\[Run || RunOnce]
	- auditpol to see what will log (this will require priv esc)
	- wevtutil or windows event viewer to view logs (this will require priv esc)
Attempt Priv Esc:
	- net user [your username] to see what groups you're in
	- net localgroup to see what the admin group is
	- Can we replace any running services or scheduled jobs with malicious binaries?
	- Is anything missing dll's we can replace with malicious versions?
	- Is there an unquoted path with a space in it?
	- Are there other users we can move laterally into who may have more permissions than us?
		

Reverse Engineer Strange Binaries:
	1) Copy back to your box
	2) Strings/file and other static analysis
	3) Run it normally to try to figure out what it does. Play around with it. See if it created any files or updated anything (remember that find command to look for files that have updated within the past X minutes?)
	4) Open it up in Ghidra and find desired output in strings, search back through functions until you find out how to get desired output
	5) Patch if you gotta


Exploit Development:
	1) follow the FG Buffer Overflow Process. It's much too complex to summarize here without leaving something important out

Your opsbox has john the ripper, a password cracker. If you can access /etc/shadow or other password hashes and get your hands on a wordlist, see if you can crack creds
	john --wordlist=/path/to/wordlist /file/with/hashes
